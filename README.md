## How It's Made:


**Tech used:** HTML & CSS


Creating this cover I put the skills I learned into practice a lot of the CSS work I did was on positioning the words and having it stay put. 


## Lessons Learned:


I had a hard time cropping the image.  Eventually I got it very close to what I wanted it to look like. This was a good practice piece.
